# deploy-lab-ansible

## Objetivo
Desplegar la infraestructura necesaria para el taller de Ansible

- 4 Máquinas RedHat 8
- Tipo de instancia: t2.micro
- Usuario local `ansible` con perfil sudo para escalado a root y acceso mediante intercambio de clave pública.


## Arquitectura

![Diagrama](images/draw.drawio.png)

## Requisitos
- Se necesita una cuenta en AWS y configurar los tokens de acceso AWS_ACCES_KEY y AWS_SECRET_KEY
- [Terraform latest](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

## Deploy

1.- Instalación de los binarios de Terraform

```bash
curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-add-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main"
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install terraform
```

2.- Configurar el token de AWS
```bash
cat ~/.aws/credentials 
[default]
aws_access_key_id = AWS_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = AWS_SECRET_KEY
```
2.- Iniciar el proyecto

Al iniciar el proyecto Terraform descargara los módulos necesarios.

```bash
terraform init

Initializing the backend...
Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/template from the dependency lock file
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/aws from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/template v2.2.0
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/aws v4.4.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```
3.- Evaluar la configuración a desplegar

`terraform plan` crea un plan de ejecución en base a la definición implementada, el estado real de la infra y el estado conocido por la herramienta en el fichero .tfstate.

En base a lo anterior, terraform devuelve un plan de ejecución mostrando los cambios que deben aplicarse en la infraestructura. No ejecuta ningún cambio.

```bash
terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
